The repository includes the following Java programs, covering key OOP concepts:

1. **Program 1: Class and Objects**  
   Demonstrates the basic concepts of classes, objects, and methods in Java.

2. **Program 2: Inheritance**  
   Showcases different types of inheritance such as single and multilevel inheritance.

   Demonstrates method overloading and method overriding in Java.

4. **Program 4: Abstraction**  
   Explains abstract classes and abstract methods through practical examples.

5. **Program 5: Interfaces**  
   Implements Java interfaces and explains multiple inheritance using interfaces.

6. **Program 6: Exception Handling**  
   A program to illustrate try-catch blocks, throw, throws, and custom exceptions.

7. **Program 7: File Handling**  
   Covers reading from and writing to files using Java I/O streams.

8. **Program 8: Multithreading**  
   Demonstrates the concept of multithreading using the `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.

9. **Program 9: Collections Framework**  
   Implements Java collections such as ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, and HashSet.
